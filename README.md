# A Coupled Model of the Cardiovascular and Immune Systems to Analyze the Effects of COVID-19 Infection

- This repository contains the Python code used to develop a coupled model of the cardiovascular and immune system response to the COVID-19 infection. It contains the two models (cardiovascular and immune), as well as the coupled version. The code also contains functions for plotting, uncertainty quantification and further analysis of the results.
